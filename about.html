          <h2>About</h2>

          <img src="imgs/wheat_start_d.jpg" alt="">

          <hr>

          <p>Coco and Seed started from the needs of another <a href="http://nessgarden.com">G.I.Y. (Grow It Yourself) business</a> that has been simplified for those wanting the basics for gardening. All you need is a little coco (coconut coir) and some seeds to get you started. The important thing to know is that anyone can garden! Yes, even those of you with thumbs that aren't green. I know from personal experience and why I started utilizing self watering garden kits.</p>

          <p>Coco and Seed brings you all the basic things you need and also lets you customize how you want to garden. You can choose from organic soil or organic coco coir and grow your plants hydroponically. What you do with them is up to you! Whether you choose to transplant them into an even bigger garden or keep them in their containers, anyone can start and grow a healthy and happy garden.</p>

          <p>I also love growing and want to share my experiences. I also grow healthy starts for those of you that want to get right in and jump start your harvest time. My favorites to grow are herbs and greens! Take a look at the available starts ready for planting.</p>

      <h2 class="spbottom">3 Tips For Growing Success:</h2>

      <h4>• Ways to Water:</h4> 
      <p>Place the container in a shallow cup of water or plant food mixture. Allow the plant to absorb and wick up the water by leaving it in the container for a minute or two. After it's done place in a sunny location. Be sure to check on it every day or every other day making sure the growing medium has not dried out. The other option is watering from the top.</p>

     <h4>• Growing from Seed:</h4>
     <p>For the herbs a little bit goes a long way (other than chives). Not a lot of seeds are needed! Follow the instructions that come with each seed pack and you'll be good to go. The most important thing is to remember to not allow your seeds to dry out when first planting them. While in the hatching phase the seeds staying moist <strong>(not soaking wet)</strong> are key! Continue to monitor your seedlings closely. Their early days are very important. They are the most vulverable and need your care and attention. With chives, they like to be grouped together so group them liberally. With the other herbs give them more room and cover more ground.</p>

     <h4>• Lover of Light</h4>
     <p>Be sure to give your plants enough light, especially if growing indoors. A windowsill can provide adequate light and is highly recommended to keep them safe from pesky and hungry critters. Enough sun light (as many hours as you can provide — 8 to 12 is optimal) provides your plants many beneficial things like non-lanky stems they don't have to stretch for and healthy leaves.</p>
